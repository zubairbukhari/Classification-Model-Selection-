# Classification-Model-Selection-
To answer one of the most frequently asked question in the Data Science community "Which classiffication model should I select/choose for my data set", I deployed all the calssification models on a data set of breast cancer which i got from UCI Machine Learning repository in which I had to predict if the tumor was benign or malignant using different features of the patients like clump thickness, uniformity of cell size & shape, marginal adhesion, and mitoses etc. I efficiently deployed all the classification models on this data set just to qucikly identify and select the best model which predicted the best result using the confusion matrix and accuracy score for this particular data set.
